So you want to collect your Docker logs and send them somewhere? Sounds simple!
Sadly, it is not. First, there are many different opinionated ways on how to
"properly" collect your Docker logs. Second, there are many caveats, such as
parsing, enriching, handling split log messages, and more. Fear not! This guide
will get you up and running in minutes, all without becoming a Docker logging
expert.

## A Step-By-Step Tutorial

### Generate fake logs

For the purpose of this guide, let's make sure we have a Docker container generating logs. We'll use of the `chentex/random-logger` image.

<ol className="sections sections--h4">
<li>

#### Start the `random-logger` container

```bash
$ docker run -d chentex/random-logger:latest
```


</li>
<li>

#### Verify log generation

```bash
$ docker logs $(docker ps | grep 'chentex/random-logger' | awk)
```

Hooray! You should see the following output:

```text
$1
```

### Collect Docker logs

To collect these logs we'll use Vector. Vector is a light-weight, high-performance utility for collecting and routing logs of all types. Collecting logs is complicated, and it's exactly the type of tool you should reach for to accomplish this task.

<ol className="sections sections--h4">
<li>

#### Configure Vector

Before we start Vector, let's create a configuration file that tells it we want to collect Docker logs:

```bash
$ echo 'file' > vector.toml
```

Notice we're using the `console` sink. We'll change this later. This helps us verify that Vector is, in fact, collecting Docker logs.


</li>
<li>

#### Start Vector

Now let's start Vector:

```bash
$ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $PWD/vector.toml:/etc/vector/vector.toml:ro timberio/vector:latest-alpine
```

Woo! You should see Vector printing the logs generated by our fake logging container.
